## **Notes**
1) In order for you to use scripts/update_sheet.py you must have the fire_danger_secrets.json in the root
  directory for the project. *DO NOT PUT THIS FILE ON GITHUB!*
2) In order for you to use the scripts/update_databse.py you must have the unitapp_admin.json in the root
  directory for the project. *DO NOT PUT THIS FILE ON GITHUB*
3) The github actions script updates the text files in the github repo once an hour but does not do anything to
  update the google sheet. The x-drive runs the same xml_parser script once a day then uses that data to update the
  google sheet.
